# Implement SI::CD::InfraFlags Component for Infrastructure Feature Flag Tracking

**Author**: adam@systeminit.com

## Summary

Implemented a complete System Initiative component (`SI::CD::InfraFlags`) to track infrastructure feature flags across deployment environments. This component enables CI/CD pipelines to verify that required infrastructure is deployed before allowing application deployments to proceed. The implementation includes the schema definition, code generation function for easy querying, and qualification function to warn about incomplete deployments.

The component tracks which infrastructure features (flags) are deployed to which environments (pr, dev, preprod, prod), allowing development teams to safely coordinate infrastructure changes with application deployments through a feature flag pattern.

## Changes Made

- **Files Modified**:
  - `design/infraflags-si.md` - Updated with completion status for all implementation steps

- **Files Created**:
  - `design/infraflags-si.md` - Complete implementation plan and documentation

- **Files Deleted**: None

- **Infrastructure Created**:
  - Schema: `SI::CD::InfraFlags` (ID: `01K7MNKQATP2K119YZW0ZRT1R6`)
    - Category: `SI::CD`
    - Color: `#4A90E2`
    - Properties: application (string), environments (array), flags (map)
  - Code Generation Function: `Environment Flags` (ID: `01K7MNV3B4A94MD6F7BZWMTVJ2`)
    - Generates JSON with `byEnvironment` and `byFlag` views
    - Alphabetically sorted arrays for consistent output
  - Qualification Function: `Incomplete Flags` (ID: `01K7MP0SNHKV8XDSQJ4NDX61JZ`)
    - Warns when flags are not deployed to all environments
    - Lists specific missing deployments
  - Test Component: `tonys-chips-infraflags-test` (ID: `01K7MP6SKH7JBP81NFES1BJP95`)
    - Validated both functions work correctly
  - Change Set: `infraflags-component` (ID: `01K7MNJJ0X4XNCMEFRBFBR4ZG5`)
    - Applied to HEAD successfully

## Technical Decisions

1. **Schema Design - Map of Arrays**: Chose to model flags as a map where keys are flag names and values are arrays of environment names. This provides flexibility for incremental rollouts and makes it easy to see at a glance which environments have which flags.

2. **Dual-View Code Generation**: The code generation function outputs both `byEnvironment` (which flags are in each env) and `byFlag` (which envs have each flag) views. This allows CI/CD systems to query either way depending on their use case without additional processing.

3. **Alphabetical Sorting**: Ensured all arrays in the code generation output are alphabetically sorted for consistent, predictable output that's easier to compare and test.

4. **Warning vs Failure Qualification**: The qualification returns a warning (not failure) when flags are incomplete. This allows teams to proceed with caution while being informed about gaps, rather than blocking all work.

5. **Display Names**: Used human-friendly display names (`Environment Flags` and `Incomplete Flags`) rather than camelCase function names for better UX in the System Initiative interface.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Function Edit API Requirements**: Initially attempted to edit a function without providing the `name` parameter, which resulted in an error. Resolution: Always include the `name` parameter when using `func-create-edit-get` for updates.

2. **Array Sorting in byFlag**: Initial implementation only sorted the `byEnvironment` arrays. Added additional sorting for the `byFlag` environment arrays to ensure complete consistency across all output.

## Prompts

```prompt
read the design at @design/infraflags.md. write a plan for implementing the system intiative component described there to desgin/infraflags-si.md. It should create the schema, the qualification, and the code generation functions.
```

```prompt
lets do step 1 and have a 'next step' entry to keep track of where we are
```

```prompt
lets make sure the arrays are sorted in the codegen func
```

```prompt
update the plan to record that step 1 is complete
```

```prompt
do step 2
```

```prompt
update step 2 to completed
```

```prompt
do step 3
```

```prompt
fix the display name for the qualification to be 'Incomplete Flags' and code gen to be 'Environment Flags'
```

```prompt
lets do step 4
```

```prompt
okay, update step four to be complete, then apply and complete step 5
```

```prompt
@../tonys-chips/build-log/prompt.md and summarize this work
```

## Next Steps

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Implement the infraflags check in the tonys-chips CI pipeline that:
   - Reads `infraflags.yaml` from the application repository
   - Queries System Initiative API for the `SI::CD::InfraFlags` component
   - Compares required flags against deployed flags for the target environment
   - Blocks deployment if required infrastructure is missing

2. **Create Production Component**: Create the actual `SI::CD::InfraFlags` component for the tonys-chips application in the production workspace (currently only test component exists).

3. **Documentation**: Document the usage pattern for development teams:
   - How to add new infrastructure flags to `infraflags.yaml`
   - How to update the SI::CD::InfraFlags component when deploying infrastructure
   - How to interpret qualification warnings

4. **Enhanced Reporting**: Consider adding a management function that can generate a deployment readiness report across all environments and flags.

5. **Flag Lifecycle Management**: Consider adding timestamps or metadata to track when flags were added/deployed to help identify stale flags that may no longer be needed.
