# Improved Build Log Prompt Template

**Author**: adam@systeminit.com

## Summary

Enhanced the build-log/prompt.md file to provide clearer guidance for generating session summaries. The original template was minimal and lacked important context and structure.

## Changes Made

- **Files Modified**: `/home/adam/src/tonys/tonys-chips/build-log/prompt.md`

## Technical Decisions

**Why these improvements were made:**
- Added title and purpose statement to clarify the document's intent
- Included placeholder definitions with concrete examples to reduce ambiguity
- Added date format example (YYYY-MM-DD) to prevent formatting inconsistencies
- Expanded template structure with sections for Changes Made, Technical Decisions, Issues Encountered, and Next Steps
- Specified behavior for existing files (append mode) to avoid confusion
- Added Best Practices section to guide quality summary writing

**Rationale:**
The original prompt was too terse and assumed users understood the context and placeholders. The improved version provides comprehensive guidance while remaining easy to follow.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward documentation improvement.

## Prompts

```prompt
suggest improvements to the build-logs/prompt.md
```

```prompt
it's in ../tonys-chips
```

```prompt
yes [to rewriting the entire prompt]
```

```prompt
@../tonys-chips/build-log/prompt.md and summarize this session
```

```prompt
update the prompt.md to also include the user who made the change (use the current git configured email)
```

```prompt
now update the existing summary to include the email appropriately
```

## Next Steps

None - the prompt template is now comprehensive and ready for use.

# Created Infrastructure Management Guide

**Author**: adam@systeminit.com

## Summary

Created a comprehensive INFRA.md file for the tonys-chips project that establishes naming conventions, AWS tagging policies, and System Initiative workflow guidance. This document serves as the authoritative reference for infrastructure management standards across the project.

## Changes Made

- **Files Created**: `/home/adam/src/tonys/tonys-chips/INFRA.md`

## Technical Decisions

**Naming Conventions:**
- Established kebab-case as the primary naming convention with lowerCamelCase as fallback
- Required Name tags to match si/name for consistency across infrastructure and UI

**AWS Tagging Policy:**
- Defined five required tags for all AWS resources: Environment, Owner, CostCenter, Application
- Standardized on PascalCase for tag keys
- Created approved value lists for Environment (Sandbox, Shared, Dev, PreProd, Prod) and CostCenter (ProjectApollo, ProjectOrigin, CustomerPortal, DevelopmentSandbox, TestingQA)
- Established DevelopmentSandbox as default CostCenter for unallocated resources

**Enforcement Strategy:**
- Documented consequences for non-compliance (automatic stops, creation denials, audit flagging)
- Emphasized team accountability for tag accuracy
- Highlighted financial impact through chargeback mechanisms

**System Initiative Integration:**
- Documented Change Set workflow (create → make changes → check qualifications → apply → monitor actions)
- Provided component configuration examples with proper subscription patterns
- Established best practices for validation and tag management

**Rationale:**
This document ensures consistency across the team, enables accurate cost allocation, and provides clear guidance for both new and experienced users working with System Initiative and AWS infrastructure.

## Issues Encountered

**Initial Environment Values:**
User corrected the Environment tag values from the initial set (Production, Staging, Development, Sandbox) to the correct organizational standard (Sandbox, Shared, Dev, PreProd, Prod) before the file was created.

## Prompts

```prompt
add a ../tonys-chips/INFRA.md file with guidance for working with System Initiative to build and manage infrastructure for the project. it should specify that we name things with kebab-case where possible, lower camel where that is not permitted, use Name tags when we need them that should match the si/name, and this tag policy: Every AWS resource must include the following tags at minimum:
- Environment (Production, Staging, Development, Sandbox)
- Owner (email responsible, initially set to creator email if unknown)
- CostCenter (internal accounting reference). One of:
    - ProjectApollo
    - ProjectOrigin
    - CustomerPortal
    - DevelopmentSandbox
    - TestingQA
  Default to DevelopmentSandbox for unallocated or unknown cases.
- Application (service, product, or project name) Create new name if unallocated or unknown cases

** Standardized Tag Keys and Values **
- All tag keys must use PascalCase (e.g., CostCenter, Application).
- All tag values must come from an approved list where applicable (e.g., Environment must be one of: Production, Staging, Development, Sandbox).

Free-form tags may be used for special cases, but should not conflict with organizational tags.

Resources without required tags may be automatically stopped, denied creation, or flagged for remediation.

Teams are accountable for maintaining tag accuracy; stale or incorrect tags will be flagged during audits.

Cost Allocation and Chargeback - The CostCenter tag is required on all billable resources (EC2, RDS, S3 buckets, Lambda, etc.). Untagged resources may be assigned to a default CostCenter and subject to higher internal chargeback rates.
```

```prompt
environments should be Sandbox, Shared, Dev, PreProd, Prod
```

## Next Steps

- Apply these standards to existing infrastructure in System Initiative
- Create example components demonstrating proper tag configuration
- Consider adding validation scripts or policies to enforce tagging requirements
- Document any project-specific Application names as they are created
