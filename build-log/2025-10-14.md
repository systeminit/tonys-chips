# Improved Build Log Prompt Template

**Author**: adam@systeminit.com

## Summary

Enhanced the build-log/prompt.md file to provide clearer guidance for generating session summaries. The original template was minimal and lacked important context and structure.

## Changes Made

- **Files Modified**: `/home/adam/src/tonys/tonys-chips/build-log/prompt.md`

## Technical Decisions

**Why these improvements were made:**
- Added title and purpose statement to clarify the document's intent
- Included placeholder definitions with concrete examples to reduce ambiguity
- Added date format example (YYYY-MM-DD) to prevent formatting inconsistencies
- Expanded template structure with sections for Changes Made, Technical Decisions, Issues Encountered, and Next Steps
- Specified behavior for existing files (append mode) to avoid confusion
- Added Best Practices section to guide quality summary writing

**Rationale:**
The original prompt was too terse and assumed users understood the context and placeholders. The improved version provides comprehensive guidance while remaining easy to follow.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward documentation improvement.

## Prompts

```prompt
suggest improvements to the build-logs/prompt.md
```

```prompt
it's in ../tonys-chips
```

```prompt
yes [to rewriting the entire prompt]
```

```prompt
@../tonys-chips/build-log/prompt.md and summarize this session
```

```prompt
update the prompt.md to also include the user who made the change (use the current git configured email)
```

```prompt
now update the existing summary to include the email appropriately
```

## Next Steps

None - the prompt template is now comprehensive and ready for use.
